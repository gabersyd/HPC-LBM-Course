    "## How fast is your Computing Machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our computers do basically two things, one is storing numbers, the other is doing mathematical operations on them. They are so useful because they do these things extraordinarily fast and extraordinarily well, in the sense that they always do them correctly following our instructions. For this reason the main way in which we use them is to give them repetitive instructions for up to billions of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the speed of the CPU has doubled every 1.5 years until a few years ago (Moore’s Law), we may have lost track of how really fast the computer in our hands is. When starting this journey into numerical modeling, it is important to first quickly experiment this and not only realize how remarkably fast it really is, but also to perceive its limits when we reach them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we start using iPython because its interactive setting allows us to feel better about what the computer does. Later we will step into writing and running a program. Let us initially load NumPy:"

    "\n",
    "Most languages today are compiled. One of the great features of compilers is that when we have to perform a set of repetitive operations on a large set of data, the compiler will take care to optimize these iterations in an exceptional way, even if we wrote a very confusing code. This is not the case with a language like Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want our Python code to run fast, we have to organize the sequence of operation in a smart way. In particular a very common case like calling an **if** command inside a for loop can make Python very slow. We have seen above how looping makes Python slow. One of the secrets that make Python fast is to use smart indexing. To use indexing, in practice it means to vectorize the command **if** and then to use these indexes to selectively operate on arrays. This might seem a terrible setback for Python programmers, however the great advantage of forcing the developer to do this operation is that the program will be written in a completely vectorized way from the start, therefore ready to be parallelized, which is in fact a huge advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and slicing in NumPy is a long topic, whose full coverage goes beyond the scope of this series of Notebooks. To gain a full understanding of the possibilities offered by NumPy, I recommend to follow one of the online free tutorials (e.g., https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/basics.indexing.html). I will cover here some of the main features, and explain in depth important details on the memory management associated to ndarrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now dive into the main features that interest us. Given an array, e.g., **arr**, we can access the element n with square brackets **arr[n]** and we can slice the array extracting the elements between n and m with the command **arr[n:m]**, which will return m − n elements (comprising **arr[n]** and excluding **arr[m]**. It is very important to understand that even if we associate a name to the slice of arr, this is only a view, not a new array implying that the m − n elements are not copied in a new allocated chunk of memory. This means that by changing the sliced array you will change the initial data. Let us look at an example to clearly understand how this works:"

    "Who is familiar with other languages might be surprised by this behavior, and believe that when defining sliceArr Python should have copied the subset of second **Arr** data into a new array. The point is that NumPy has been designed to deal with very large datasets or numerical models, therefore it uses a policy of minimization of memory usage. For this reason, if one does not force NumPy to create a copy of the sliced data, it will simply generate a *view* of the already existing array. NumPy can be forced to create a separate new array by adding **.copy()** to the slice, e.g., in our case **sliceArr = secondArr[4:10].copy()**.\n",
